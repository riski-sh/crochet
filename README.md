# Crochet

Crochet is an open source crypto broker and crypto router to enable
the ability for decentralized crypto trading. A common problem with exchanges
today is that no routing between exchanges exist. Crochet attempts to solve
this problem today being either your personal broker or a crypto router
between exchanges to ensure best prices.
